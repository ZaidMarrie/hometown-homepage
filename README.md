# Hometown Homepage (Solo Project Solution)

This is my solution to the [Hometown Homepage Solo Project on Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/learn/htmlandcss/solo-project-hometown-homepage-cob2e4812840974342ebb42eb). The solo projects are part of the [Scrimba Platform's Courses](https://scrimba.com/allcourses).

## Overview

### The challenge

You are required to do the following:

- Build the site from scratch
- Make use of classes
- Make use of flexbox
- Make use of background-image
- Make use of given color-palette

The following is not required, but they are some stretch goals to take this project further:

- Make it about your own hometown, country, or whatever place you like
- Use a different color palette
- Add a google font
- Find a way to use the `:hover` psuedo-class
- Add a whole new section

### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
	color: papayawhip;
}
```
